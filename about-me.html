            <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
            <p>
                
                <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>
                <p> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, 
                but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. 
                Things were terrible.                     
                I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
                </p>
                <h3>How I turned things around</h3> 
                <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. </strong>
                <p> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, 
                    sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. 
                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, 
                    I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. 
                </p>
                <h3>Now I live the simple life </h3>
                <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.
                    I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, 
                    and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
